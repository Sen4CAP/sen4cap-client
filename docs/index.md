Welcome to the documentation of the Python client for the processing service of 
the [ESA Sen4CAP project](https://www.esa-sen4cap.org/)!

The ESA Sen4CAP project aims to provide European and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) stakeholders 
with validated algorithms, products, workflows and best practices for agricultural monitoring that 
are relevant for CAP management.

_Note, the Python client and its documentation is still in an early development stage._
